# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is an honours dissertation currently in active development. Only the latest version is supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | yes |

## Security by Design

This toolkit is designed with privacy and security in mind:

- **Offline Mode**: When using WebAssembly mode, your data never leaves your device
- **No Data Storage**: The server does not store or log any uploaded data
- **No External Dependencies**: Core algorithms are implemented from scratch without external libraries
- **Open Source**: All code is available for inspection and auditing

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Email**: Send details to calumxkerr@gmail.com
2. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
3. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Depends on severity and complexity

## What to Expect

- I will acknowledge your report and keep you informed of progress
- I will credit you in the fix (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- Please allow reasonable time to address the issue before public disclosure

## Scope

This policy applies to the data cleaning toolkit hosted at:

- GitHub: https://github.com/Calum-Kerr/data-cleaning-toolkit
- Live Demo: https://www.calumkerr.com/app

## Academic Context

Please note this is a student project for Edinburgh Napier University. While I take security seriously, this tool is intended for educational and demonstration purposes rather than production use with sensitive data.
